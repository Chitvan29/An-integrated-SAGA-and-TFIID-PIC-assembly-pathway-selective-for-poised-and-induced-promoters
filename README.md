# An-integrated-SAGA-and-TFIID-PIC-assembly-pathway-selective-for-poised-and-induced-promoters

Genome-wide, little is understood about how proteins organize at inducible promoters before and after induction and to what extent inducible and constitutive architectures depend on cofactors. We report that sequence-specific transcription factors and their tethered cofactors (e.g., SAGA [Spt–Ada–Gcn5–acetyltransferase], Mediator, TUP, NuA4, SWI/SNF, and RPD3-L) are generally bound to promoters prior to induction (“poised”), rather than recruited upon induction, whereas induction recruits the preinitiation complex (PIC) to DNA. Through depletion and/or deletion experiments, we show that SAGA does not function at constitutive promoters, although a SAGA-independent Gcn5 acetylates +1 nucleosomes there. When inducible promoters are poised, SAGA catalyzes +1 nucleosome acetylation but not PIC assembly. When induced, SAGA catalyzes acetylation, deubiquitylation, and PIC assembly. Surprisingly, SAGA mediates induction by creating a PIC that allows TFIID (transcription factor II-D) to stably associate, rather than creating a completely TFIID-independent PIC, as generally thought. These findings suggest that inducible systems, where present, are integrated with constitutive systems.
